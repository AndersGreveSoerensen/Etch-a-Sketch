# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project I aimed to create what is essentially an online drawing board, somewhat similar to freehand paint, with features like picking a color, rainbow drawing, eraser, shading and tinting.

In the project i got to practice DOM manipulation quite extensively, and had my first real experience with building a relatively large (300+ lines of code) project. 

Some lessons i take with me from this project is to utilize comments throughout the code, specifically when creating functions. And also, to try and keep the code as clean as possible while doing the project, as opposed to cleaning it up when finished.
